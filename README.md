# BLINK!

This is a silly-simple [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/) application.  The app itself just blinks text.  That's it.  

## Installables

You'll want both Gin and Gin Static for this, which you can install thusly:

    go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
    go get github.com/gin-gonic/contrib/static
